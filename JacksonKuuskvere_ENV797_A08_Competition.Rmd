## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup}
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
library(Kendall)
library(tseries)
library(outliers)
library(tidyverse)
library(smooth)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(readxl)

```

## Data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r data, echo=FALSE}

# loading data
load_RAW <- read_excel("./Data/load.xlsx",col_names=TRUE)
humidity_RAW <- read_excel("./Data/relative_humidity.xlsx",col_names=TRUE)
temperature_RAW <- read_excel("./Data/temperature.xlsx",col_names=TRUE)

# cleaning data in pipe
load_clean <- load_RAW %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>%  ## create date object
  mutate(daily_average = rowMeans(select(., h1:h24))) %>% # transforming hourly data into daily data
  select(-h1:-h24) %>% # dropping hourly columns
  select(-meter_id) ## drop meter ID


## GO BAKC AND CHECK THIS CODE
## check for missing dates by creating dummy data frame for dates
Days <- as.data.frame(seq.Date(from=as.Date("2005/01/01"),to=as.Date("2011/06/30"), by ="day"))
colnames(Days) <- "date"

#merge with the data with missing rows
date_check <-left_join(Days, load_clean, by="date")

# checking N/As
check_na <- is.na(date_check)
colSums(check_na) 

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)


```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
