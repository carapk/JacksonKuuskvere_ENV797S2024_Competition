TSA Spring 2024 Competition
Purpose:
Spring 2024 Competition Repository for Time Series Analysis
This repository is for work completed for the NSOE Time Series modeling competition hosted by Dr. Luana Lima. This analysis uses hourly electricity demand, hourly temperature, and hourly humidity data from January 2005 to June 2011. We aim to use time series analysis in order to predict daily electricity demand data for June 2011 with lowest error, with a vannila model as a baseline.
